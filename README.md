# NGS_analysis
Shell scripts for NGS analysis

Contains scripts for trimming, genome assembly, somatic variant calling, and bacterial wgs processing.

## Bacterial wgs processing 
> Trimming 
> Variant calling through snippy
> Genome assembly through Unicycler

## Human genome processing (somatic variants)
Note: Since no tumor WES is available the script is just using wes from the patient (normal,germline)
using gatk workflow
